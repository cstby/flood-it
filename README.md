## Overview

I was inspired to create this game after implementing a flood-fill producedure in Clojure.

I used the following dependenices:
- [Reagent](https://github.com/reagent-project/reagent) for component rendering
- [Reframe](https://github.com/Day8/re-frame) for event and subscription handling
- [Garden](https://github.com/noprompt/garden) for styling css from clojure
